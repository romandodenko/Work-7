          <h2><strong>What Are Cookies</strong></h2>

          <p>As is common practice with almost all professional websites this site uses cookies, which are tiny files
            that are downloaded to your computer, to improve your experience. This page describes what information they
            gather, how we use it and why we sometimes need to store these cookies. We will also share how you can
            prevent these cookies from being stored however this may downgrade or 'break' certain elements of the sites
            functionality.</p>

          <h2><strong>How We Use Cookies</strong></h2>

          <p>We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below. Unfortunately in most cases there are no industry
            standard options for disabling cookies without completely disabling the functionality and features they add
            to this site. It is recommended that you leave on all cookies if you are not sure whether you need them or
            not in case they are used to provide a service that you use.</p>

          <h2><strong>Disabling Cookies</strong></h2>

          <p>You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser (see your browser Help for
            how to do this). Be aware that disabling cookies will affect the functionality of this and many other
            websites that you visit. Disabling cookies will usually result in also disabling certain functionality and
            features of the this site. Therefore it is recommended that you do not disable cookies.</p>

          <h2><strong>The Cookies We Set</strong></h2>

          <ul>

            <li>
              <p>Surveys related cookies</p>
              <p>From time to time we offer user surveys and questionnaires to provide you with interesting insights,
                helpful tools, or to understand our user base more accurately. These surveys may use cookies to remember
                who has already taken part in a survey or to provide you with accurate results after you change pages.
              </p>
            </li>

          </ul>

          <h2><strong>Third Party Cookies</strong></h2>

          <p>In some special cases we also use cookies provided by trusted third parties. The following section details
            which third party cookies you might encounter through this site.</p>

          <ul>

            <li>
              <p>As we sell products it's important for us to understand statistics about how many of the visitors to
                our site actually make a purchase and as such this is the kind of data that these cookies will track.
                This is important to you as it means that we can accurately make business predictions that allow us to
                monitor our advertising and product costs to ensure the best possible price.</p>
            </li>

          </ul>

          <h2><strong>More Information</strong></h2>

          <p>Hopefully that has clarified things for you and as was previously mentioned if there is something that you
            aren't sure whether you need or not it's usually safer to leave cookies enabled in case it does interact
            with one of the features you use on our site.</p>
